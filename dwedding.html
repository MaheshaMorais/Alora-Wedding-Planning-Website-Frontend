            <h1>Caribbean: Antigua</h1>
        <p>Why get hitched here: <br>Take your pick from over 300 super-fine sandy beaches for your nuptials. Antigua's most popular beach, Half Moon Bay, was voted one of the world's ultimate beaches and is now a national park. However, Dickenson Bay (a beach on the northwest coast) is also home to hotels, restaurants and water sports facilities. In addition to its long list of all-inclusive resorts offering wedding packages and planners, Antigua's coast is lined with coconut palms and bordered by warm cerulean waters (aka an idyllic ceremony backdrop). For something a little less developed, check out the beaches of the south and southwest coasts. Antigua is also known for its seafood, so you and your guests can enjoy a delicious postwedding dinner.<br>

        When to wed: <br>If you're looking to save some cash, it's best to travel to Antigua during the off-season, which is May to November. The rates are lower, and the weather hovers around 80 degrees (though there is a slight hurricane threat). Looking to avoid rain entirely? Aim for a date between December and April—but prepare for higher costs and more crowds.</p>

            <h1>Caribbean: Jamaica</h1>
        <p>Why Get Hitched Here: <br>There's a reason glamorous globe-trotters call it home (Ian Fleming wrote the first James Bond book, Casino Royale, from his seaside abode here). Jamaica is an ideal destination wedding location, because it offers much more than just beaches and palm trees. It's steeped in culture: reggae, Rastafarianism, indigenous spices and a fun-loving, laid-back atmosphere. The site of many all-inclusive resorts, Jamaica can be one of the most affordable of the Caribbean islands on which to wed, but it has super-luxe options too, including private villas that come with their own chefs, housekeeping staffs and security. The resorts of Montego Bay offer the ultimate in service and convenience; the cliffs and beaches of Negril are great for intimate sunset ceremonies; and the gardens and waterfalls of Ocho Rios provide gorgeous backdrops.<br>

        When to Wed: <br>Avoid March, aka spring-break season, as well as the hurricane season from June through November.</p>

             <h1>Far-Flung: Costa Rica</h1>
        <p>Why Get Hitched Here: <br>With two breathtaking coasts only a short plane ride away from each other—one on the Pacific, the other on the Caribbean—Costa Rica is the perfect destination for couples who are looking for an unspoiled tropical background for their nuptials but don't want to sacrifice their modern urban tastes. In fact, this small country truly has something for every couple, which is why it makes our list of best places for a destination wedding. Treat your guests to amazing mountaintop views during an outdoor ceremony or reception, or for a truly standout affair, you can even get married on the edge of a volcano! If you're dreaming of a beach bash, how do sun-baked stretches of white sand sound? Though deforestation once threatened the country's dense rain forests, several nature preserves, biological reserves and national parks have been established to protect the landscape, and they're now some of the most naturally stunning places to say "I do" (think: waterfall wedding). Ecotourism is very popular here, making less traditional but equally luxurious eco-lodges and rain forest bungalows another desirable (and romantic) option for couples who want to throw a green wedding.<br>

        When to Wed: <br>You'll want to schedule your wedding during the dry season, from late December through April, except on the Caribbean coast, where it rains throughout the year (the Pacific coast is drier). The temperature and humidity vary with altitude but are much higher along the coasts.</p>

             <h1>Mexico: Cozumel</h1>
        <p>Why Get Hitched Here: <br>Set just off the Yucatan Peninsula, this peaceful island in the Caribbean is framed by one of the largest coral reef systems in the world, surrounded by turquoise waters and home to wildlife-filled nature reserves, which spells P-A-R-A-D-I-S-E for outdoorsy couples looking for a quiet spot (read: away from the tourist crowds) to tie the knot. Expect lush grounds and pristine swaths of sand, plus a range of resorts (including many luxe all-inclusives) with impeccable service and on-site wedding planners and vendors to help you plan your perfect party. Nature-loving couples and their guests will love Cozumel's Chankanaab National Park, where you can check out a lagoon, botanical gardens and a replica of a Mayan village, and find incredible snorkeling. When the more laid-back guests tire of sipping cocktails and sunning themselves on the beach, they can hit up the shops and restaurants of downtown San Miguel.<br>

        When to Wed: <br>High season begins in mid-December and typically lasts through Easter, with the rainy season running from May through mid-October. Although temps may only top out at 90 degrees during the summer, the humidity can make it uncomfortably hot. And beware of spring-break crowds in March and April.</p>

             <h1>Mexico: Los Cabos</h1>
        <p>Why Get Hitched Here: <br>Fun in the surf and sun is what Los Cabos—which stretches from the town of Cabo San Lucas to the west over to San Jose del Cabo to the east, along the southernmost coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula—is all about. In between the two is the Corridor, a 20-mile string of cozy hotels, championship golf courses, winding horse trails and white-sand beaches. Lively Cabo San Lucas draws plenty of celebrities, meaning there's no shortage of uber-exclusive beach clubs and villas, plus plenty of fuss-free all-inclusives, so finding a venue and accommodations for your guests will be a breeze. You can also take a boat ride to a private beach or cove to say your vows (how's that for special?). Looking for something a little different? Enter your beach ceremony by horse, or make the release of baby sea turtles part of your wedding program. Cabo San Lucas is also home to the region's iconic giant rock arch at Land's End, where the deep-blue waters of the Pacific and the Sea of Cortez meet for some spectacular waves<br>.

        When to Wed: <br>Winter months have the best weather, but are crowded, with sunny, 70-degree days mid-December through Easter. Try April and May, traditionally slower months when the weather's still good. Avoid spring-break season, which runs from late February through March. Though summer offers the best prices, humidity is uncomfortably high then. Rain is heaviest in June and October, with hurricanes possible through November.<br></p>

            <h1>Mexico: Riviera Maya<br></h1>
        <p>Why Get Hitched Here: This coastal stretch of the Yucatan Peninsula along the Mexican Caribbean mixes ancient Mayan ruins with palm-fringed beaches to give your wedding a real tropical feel. Farther north, seemingly carved out of the jungle, Cancun sits at the tip of the peninsula, twinkling with big resorts and a boisterous nightlife. Choose a property in Cancun's hopping Hotel Zone, book an entire boutique hotel or go for a hacienda-style wedding in a Mayan village near one of the ancient archaeological sites. The ruins of the ancient Mayan empire in seaside Tulum provide a stunning backdrop. For a slower-paced setting, try Playa del Carmen, which displays an authentic rustic charm and is home to some gorgeous beaches. And there's no shortage of natural settings here, either: Say "I do" in a lush, tropical garden, in a beautiful eco-park or among the cenotes, or freshwater pools, the Riviera Maya is famous for.<br>

        When to Wed:<br> Winter months offer the best weather but are crowded, with sunny, 80-degree days from mid-December through Easter. Avoid spring-break season, late February through March. April and May are traditionally slower months, and the weather's still good. Rain is heaviest in June and October, with hurricanes possible through November.

             <h1>US: The Big Island, Hawaii</h1>
        <p>Why Get Hitched Here:<br> The Big Island is (you may have guessed) the largest island in the chain and offers incredibly diverse topography. In fact, 11 of the world's 13 climatic zones can be found on the island (there's even snow on top of the highest mountains!). The landscape varies dramatically as you travel around the perimeter, so you'll have your choice of backdrops: The Kona coast to the west has a lunar-like landscape, while the north and east coasts are wet and super-lush. There's plenty for guests to do too, from exploring the rain forest region to going horseback riding, snorkeling or just lazing on the beach. You won't have to go anywhere for a dream honeymoon. These are just some of the reasons we consider The Big Island on our list of best destination wedding locations.<br>

        When to Wed: <br>Anytime—year-round, temperatures are in the 70s and 80s during the day. Dry season runs May through October, but even in winter, rain showers are short and mild. If you're looking to save a little cash, avoid winter through early spring, when tourist season is in full swing.</p>
